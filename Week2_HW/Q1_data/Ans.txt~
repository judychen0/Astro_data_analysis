b)They are point sources. Some of their colors are dim and tend to be violet, some are bright sky blue at the center with their outer part a little green. In general, they are blue.

c)Most of their spectra have stong emission lines above the continum. By observing their emission lines, we found that some stars have redshifted emmission lines, such as Ly-alpha which normally has the wavelength 1216 angstroms and should be in ultraviolet region, but now appears on the visible spectum. Therefore, this is a dataset of quasars.
